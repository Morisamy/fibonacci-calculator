# Fibonacci Calculator

## Overview
This script calculates Fibonacci numbers using recursion with memoization. The memoization technique optimizes recursive calls by storing previously computed values.

## Usage
1. Load the script in a Common Lisp environment.
2. Call `(fibonacci n)` where `n` is the Fibonacci sequence position.

## Features
- Memoization technique to avoid redundant calculations.
- Demonstrates recursive function definitions in Common Lisp.
